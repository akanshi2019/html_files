  While  designing  a  relational  schema  semantics  of  attributes,  reducing  the 
redundant values in a tuple, reducing null valuesin tuples and avoiding generation 
of spurious tuples are some of the issues that need to be taken care of. 
2.  Design  the  base  relation schemas so  that  no  insertion, deletion,  or  modification 
anomalies are present in the relations. 
3.  Redundancy  arises  when  a  relational  schema  forces  an  association  between 
attributes that is not natural. Functional dependencies can 'be used to identify such 
situations and suggest refinements to the schema. 
4.  A  functional  dependency  is  a  property  of  the  semantics  of  the  attributes  in  a 
relation. The semantics indicate how attributes relate to one another, and specify 
the functional dependencies between attributes. 
5.  A  table  is  in  first  normal  form  (1NF)  if  and  only  if  all  columns  contain  only 
atomic values, that is, each column can  have only one value for each row in the 
table. 
6.  A  superkey is  a  set  of  one  or  more  attributes,  which,  when  taken  collectively, 
allows us to identify uniquely an entity or table. 
30
7.  Any  subset  of  the  attributes  of  a  superkey  that  is  also  a  superkey,  and  not 
reducible to another superkey, is called a candidate key. 
8.  A  primary key is selected arbitrarily fromthe set of candidate keys to be used in 
an index for that table. 
9.  A  table  R  is  in  Boyce-Codd  normal  form  (BCNF)  if  for  every  nontrivial  FD 
X->A, X is a superkey.
