TIT-402 		UNIX AND SHELL PROGRAMMING
UNIT-I
Q1.	What is UNIX OS? What are its salient features?
Q2.	Differentiate between Multitasking and Multiuser OS?
Q3.	Which different security mechanisms are available in UNIX?
Q4.	Explain 3 layered architecture of UNIX, with diagram?
Q5.	Explain the UNIX file system with diagram?
Q6.	What are the components of a UNIX file system? What are the content of an Inode block? 
Q7.	What are system calls and what role do they play in the system?
Q8.	Explain vi editor? What are the 3 modes of the vi editor?
Q9.	What are the basic attributes of a file in UNIX? Differentiate between l s &ls  –l.
Q10.	Explain the types of files in UNIX OS with examples.

UNIT-II
Q1.	What are the basic file manipulated commands? Explain with examples.
Q2.	What are the basic directory manipulated commands? Explain with examples.
Q3.	What are the basic system Related commands? Explain with examples.
Q4.	How to find hidden files in current directory? ls -lrta
Q5.	How to tails last 200 lines of any log fine?    $ tail -200f filename.txt
Q6.	find all files in current and subdirectories which contains 'log' name?  $ find . -name 'log'
Q7.	How will you find which operating system your system is running on in UNIX?uname –a
Q8.	How do DOS and UNIX text files differ ?name the utilities that convert files between these two formats ?
Q9.	Name three advantages zip over gzip .how do we use tar to add two files to an archive , explain with examples.
Q10.Differentiate cmp command from diff command.
Ans. The cmp command is used mainly to compare two files byte by byte, after which the first encountered mismatch is shown. On the other hand, the diff command is used to indicate the changes that are to be made in order to make the two files identical to each other.
